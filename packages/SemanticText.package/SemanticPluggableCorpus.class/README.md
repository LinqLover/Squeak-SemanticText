I provide a simpler way to create maintain arbitrary domain objects through pluggable blocks for retrieving object texts.
I store all objects as SemanticPluggableFragmentDocuments. Note that pluggable documents may involve memory overhead. See the comment SemanticPluggableFragmentDocument for details.
